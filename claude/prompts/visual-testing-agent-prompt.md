## Context: Our Project
This guide will be used for a **TypeScript/Next.js transcript analysis application** that:
- Uses React components with Tailwind CSS styling
- Has a dashboard interface for transcript management
- Implements upload forms, data tables, and analysis visualizations
- Requires cross-browser compatibility and responsive design
- Follows TDD methodology with comprehensive test coverage
- Uses existing Cypress test infrastructure
- Needs integration with CI/CD pipelines

## Prompt Optimization Instructions

### Comparative Analysis Approach
For each tool section, structure your analysis as:
1. **Strengths** - What this tool excels at
2. **Weaknesses** - Limitations and trade-offs
3. **Best fit scenarios** - When to choose this tool
4. **Integration complexity** - Setup and maintenance effort
5. **Cost considerations** - Pricing and ROI analysis

### Structured Decision Framework
Provide decision matrices using this format:
```
| Criteria | Percy | Chromatic | Applitools | Weight |
|----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
| Speed    | 3/5   | 5/5       | 4/5        | High   |
| Accuracy | 4/5   | 4/5       | 5/5        | High   |
| Cost     | 2/5   | 4/5       | 2/5        | Medium |
```
