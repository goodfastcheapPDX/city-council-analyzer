Your goal is to examine our current architecture, GitHub issues, and implementation roadmap for **City Council Analyzer** and propose improvements.

GENERAL FLOW
1. **Clarify Before Acting**  
   - Generate up to 10 concise questions that will help you improve milestone grouping into progressive MVP stages (“🛹 Skateboard → 🛴 Scooter → 🚲 Bicycle → 🏍️ Motorcycle → 🚗 Car”).  
   - Wait for my answers before continuing.

2. **Collect Inputs**  
   After clarifications, pull the latest GitHub issues, milestones, and project boards (use `gh issue list --json` / `gh api` as needed) so you have the full current state.

3. **Analyse & Re-structure**  
   - Evaluate alignment between architecture, issues, and roadmap.  
   - Identify gaps, overlaps, YAGNI items, and missing dependencies.  
   - Propose a re-grouped milestone plan where *each* stage delivers a “thin but complete” end-to-end slice of user value (Henrik Kniberg model).  

4. **Deliverables**  
   Respond with **three sections only**:

   **A. Executive Summary** – one short paragraph.  
   **B. Revised MVP Milestone Map** – Markdown table:
   | Stage | Goal (user value) | Included Issues | New Issues Needed | Exit Criteria |
   Use the 🛹🛴🚲🏍️🚗 emojis for Stage.

   **C. Recommendations & Next Steps** – bullet list (≤ 10 bullets).

STYLE GUIDELINES
- Be brutally specific; no vague “improve architecture” comments.  
- Reference issues by number (#123).  
- Highlight blockers and critical path.  
- Prefer actions over abstract critique.  
- Keep total output ≤ 1,000 words.

| -- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1  | **🛹 Minimal Upload & Search** — User can upload a single transcript (TXT/VTT/JSON) and run a plain‐text keyword search in a bare-bones web UI. Exit: search returns matches within <2 s round-trip.                  | “Set up backend storage.” (vague, tech-only, no user value, no exit criteria).       |
| 2  | **🛹 CLI Import Script** — Provide a one-command script that ingests a local folder of transcript files, normalises formats, and confirms success per file. Exit: script passes on at least three sample files.       | “Write some ingestion utilities.” (undefined scope, no success measure).             |
| 3  | **🛴 Speaker Attribution Overlay** — Display who is speaking beside each search hit, powered by simple heuristics. Exit: ≥80 % speaker tags correct on test meeting #17.                                              | “Improve speaker model.” (no user-visible deliverable, unclear quality bar).         |
| 4  | **🛴 Basic Trend Chart** — From any filtered set of search results, plot frequency of term usage over meeting timeline. Exit: chart renders in browser without errors for queries under 1 k hits.                     | “Add charts library.” (library install ≠ user-facing feature).                       |
| 5  | **🚲 Semantic Search POC** — Embed transcripts with sentence-BERT, allow cosine-similarity queries in UI; fall back to keyword if score < 0.5. Exit: demo query “affordable housing” returns top-5 relevant passages. | “Integrate vector DB.” (integration alone doesn’t prove search quality or UX).       |
| 6  | **🚲 Multi-File Dashboard** — Users can search across any subset of uploaded meetings and filter by committee & date range. Exit: cross-meeting query completes < 4 s for 50 files.                                   | “Hook up date filters.” (partial, not end-to-end, no performance goal).              |
| 7  | **🏍️ Speaker Metrics Report** — Auto-generate CSV & HTML summaries (talk time, interrupt counts) per speaker for a selected date range. Exit: metrics export matches manual audit within ±5 %.                       | “Add analytics endpoints.” (backend only, no clear outputs or accuracy spec).        |
| 8  | **🏍️ Policy Evolution Timeline** — Highlight first + most-recent appearances of key terms & link to minutes. Exit: timeline view loads for any tracked term without server error.                                    | “Implement policy tracker.” (too broad; “implement” gives no slice, no finish line). |
| 9  | **🚗 Role-Based Sharing & ACLs** — Admins can invite read-only viewers; permissions enforced in API & UI tests. Exit: unauthorised requests return 403; Cypress suite green.                                          | “Add auth.” (massive scope, unclear roles, no acceptance criteria).                  |
| 10 | **🚗 Production Hardening & Docs** — Deploy on managed Postgres + S3, add uptime monitor, write “Getting Started” guide; staging uptime ≥ 99 % for two weeks. Exit: monitor reports green, docs merged.               | “Finish everything for prod.” (hand-wave, impossible to verify, mixes tasks).        |
