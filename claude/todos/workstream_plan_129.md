## Issue Overview
**Title:** [STORAGE] Set Up Supabase Storage Infrastructure
**Priority:** P0-Foundation
**Assignee:** Unassigned
**Issue URL:** https://github.com/user/city-council-analyzer/issues/129

### Requirements Summary
Set up Supabase Storage infrastructure to replace Vercel Blob Storage across all environments (local, test, production), including bucket creation, security policies, and proper configuration management for handling transcript file uploads.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `transcripts` bucket exists in local development environment
- [ ] `transcripts` bucket exists in test environment  
- [ ] `transcripts` bucket exists in production environment (when ready)
- [ ] RLS policies configured for appropriate access control
- [ ] File upload/download permissions working correctly
- [ ] Bucket configuration supports 50MB file size limit
- [ ] Migration script includes bucket setup SQL
- [ ] Local Supabase config.toml updated with bucket configuration

## Technical Analysis

### Affected Components
- **Database:** Supabase storage buckets and policies
- **Configuration:** supabase/config.toml file updates
- **Migrations:** New SQL migration file for bucket setup
- **Security:** RLS policies for access control
- **Infrastructure:** Multi-environment bucket deployment

### Key Dependencies
- **Internal:** Existing Supabase project setup and database connection
- **External:** Supabase CLI access and project permissions
- **Blocking:** None (foundational P0 setup)

### Risk Assessment
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|------------|
| Bucket creation fails | High | Low | Test with Supabase CLI first, validate permissions |
| RLS policies too restrictive | Medium | Medium | Start with permissive policies, tighten incrementally |
| File size limits not enforced | Medium | Low | Test upload limits before production deployment |
| CORS configuration issues | Medium | Medium | Follow Supabase documentation for proper CORS setup |

  - **Dependencies:** Tasks 1-2 completed
  - **Definition of Done:** Bucket visible in local Supabase Dashboard with correct settings
  - **Completed:** Migration 20250624212553_add_transcripts_bucket.sql applied successfully, transcripts bucket created with 50MB limit and proper MIME types

### Phase 2: Testing and Validation (Estimated: 1-2 hours)
- [x] **Task 4** - File Upload Testing ✅ COMPLETED
  - **Details:** Test file upload functionality through Supabase Dashboard and verify public URL access
  - **Dependencies:** Task 3 completed ✅

  - **Completed:** Successfully uploaded JSON and TXT files, verified public URL access, confirmed 50MB file size limit enforcement, resolved MIME type issues with wildcard configuration

- [x] **Task 5** - Security Policy Validation ✅ COMPLETED
  - **Details:** Verify RLS policies work correctly and file size limits are enforced
  - **Dependencies:** Task 4 completed ✅
  - **Definition of Done:** Policies prevent unauthorized access and enforce 50MB limit
  - **Completed:** Verified public bucket security model works correctly - upload/delete operations require authorization, 50MB file size limit enforced, proper error codes for unauthorized access, authenticated operations function correctly

### Phase 3: Environment Preparation (Estimated: 1 hour)
- [ ] **Task 6** - Test Environment Deployment Plan
  - **Details:** Document steps for deploying storage setup to test environment
  - **Dependencies:** Tasks 1-5 completed
  - **Definition of Done:** Clear instructions for test environment bucket setup

- [ ] **Task 7** - Production Readiness Documentation
  - **Details:** Create production deployment checklist and security considerations
  - **Dependencies:** Task 6 completed
  - **Definition of Done:** Production deployment guide with security best practices

## Effort Estimation
- **Total Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours
- **Critical Path Duration:** 4 hours (sequential migration → config → testing)
- **Parallelizable Work:** Documentation can be written while testing
- **Team Size Recommendation:** 1 developer

## Testing Strategy
- **Functional Tests:** Manual testing through Supabase Dashboard interface
- **Security Tests:** Verify RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
- **Integration Tests:** File upload/download workflow validation
- **Performance Tests:** File size limit enforcement testing
- **Property Tests:** Not applicable for infrastructure setup

## Deployment Plan
- [ ] **Development:** Local Supabase environment with migration execution
- [ ] **Testing:** Apply same migration to test Supabase project
- [ ] **Production:** Execute migration with production-specific security policies
- [ ] **Rollback Plan:** Remove bucket and policies if issues arise

## Success Metrics
- **Functional:** All acceptance criteria met, bucket operations working
- **Security:** RLS policies functioning correctly, unauthorized access blocked
- **Performance:** File upload/download operations complete within reasonable time
- **User Experience:** Developers can use storage for transcript management

## Branch Workflow
1. **Create branch:** `git checkout -b storage/129-supabase-storage-infrastructure`
2. **Regular commits:** Use conventional commit format (feat/chore/docs)
3. **Push frequently:** `git push -u origin storage/129-supabase-storage-infrastructure`
4. **Draft PR early:** Create draft PR for visibility during development
5. **Final review:** Convert to ready for review when all tasks complete

## Next Actions
1. **Immediate (Next 1-2 hours):**
   - Create the recommended branch
   - Write the storage migration SQL file
   - Update supabase/config.toml with storage configuration

2. **Short-term (This session):**
   - Execute migration in local environment
   - Test bucket creation and file operations
   - Validate security policies and access controls

3. **Before Implementation:**
   - Ensure Supabase CLI is installed and configured
   - Verify local Supabase project is running
   - Back up current configuration before changes

## Implementation Notes

### Migration File Structure
The SQL migration should include:
- Bucket creation with proper settings
- RLS policies for read/write access
- MIME type restrictions for security
- File size limit enforcement
- Public access configuration for development

### Configuration Updates
The config.toml should specify:
- Storage bucket settings
- File size limits
- CORS configuration
- Security policy settings

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Bucket appears in Supabase Dashboard
- [ ] File upload works through dashboard
- [ ] Public URL access functions correctly
- [ ] File size limits properly enforced
- [ ] RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
- [ ] Migration script runs without errors

### Security Considerations
- Use public access for development/testing
- Plan stricter policies for production
- Implement proper authentication checks
- Consider audit logging for file operations
- Regular security policy reviews
