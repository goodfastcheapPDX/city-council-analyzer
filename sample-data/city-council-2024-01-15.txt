MAYOR JOHNSON: Good evening everyone. I'd like to call this regular meeting of the Riverside City Council to order at 7:02 PM. We have a quorum present. 

Let's begin with the Pledge of Allegiance, led by Councilmember Davis.

COUNCILMEMBER DAVIS: Thank you, Mayor. Please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.

[Pledge of Allegiance recited]

MAYOR JOHNSON: Thank you. Now we'll move to public comments. We have three speakers signed up tonight. First is Janet Thompson regarding the downtown parking situation.

JANET THOMPSON: Thank you, Mayor Johnson and council members. I'm here representing the Downtown Business Association. We're experiencing significant challenges with parking availability, especially during evening hours. Our customers are having difficulty finding spaces, which is hurting local businesses. We propose implementing a time-limited parking system during peak hours and possibly adding more diagonal parking on Main Street. I have a petition here with 47 signatures from local business owners supporting this initiative.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Thank you, Ms. Thompson. Your comments have been noted, and we'll ask staff to prepare a report on downtown parking solutions for our next meeting.

Next speaker is David Rodriguez regarding the proposed community center expansion.

DAVID RODRIGUEZ: Good evening, council. I'm speaking in favor of the community center expansion project. As a parent of three children who regularly use the facility, I can tell you it's overcrowded. The youth programs are turning away kids due to space limitations. The proposed expansion would add 5,000 square feet, including a new gymnasium and additional classroom space. This investment in our community's future is essential. I urge you to approve the funding tonight.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Rodriguez. 

Our final speaker is Maria Santos regarding street maintenance in the Elmwood neighborhood.

MARIA SANTOS: Thank you, mayor. I live on Elm Street, and the condition of our roads is unacceptable. We have potholes that haven't been fixed in over a year, and the street flooding during last month's storm damaged several cars. The city promised repairs six months ago, but nothing has happened. We need immediate action, not more delays.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Thank you, Ms. Santos. City Manager Bradley, can you provide an update on the Elmwood street repairs?

CITY MANAGER BRADLEY: Yes, Mayor. The Elmwood project is scheduled to begin March 1st. We've secured the contractor, and materials have been ordered. The delay was due to budget allocation issues that have now been resolved. We'll notify residents one week before work begins.

MARIA SANTOS: March 1st is still six weeks away. What about the flooding issue?

CITY MANAGER BRADLEY: Public Works has installed temporary drainage measures, and we'll monitor the situation. If there are additional storms, we have emergency repair protocols in place.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Thank you. That concludes public comments. Let's move to our consent agenda.

The consent agenda includes items 1 through 5: approval of minutes from December 18th meeting, acceptance of the monthly financial report, authorization for the street sweeping contract renewal, approval of the library book purchase requisition, and ratification of the emergency water line repair on Oak Avenue.

Do any council members wish to pull an item for separate discussion?

COUNCILMEMBER CHEN: I'd like to pull item 3, the street sweeping contract, for discussion.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Item 3 is pulled. All in favor of approving consent agenda items 1, 2, 4, and 5?

COUNCIL: Aye. [Unanimous]

MAYOR JOHNSON: Motion carries 5-0. Now let's discuss item 3, the street sweeping contract renewal. Councilmember Chen?

COUNCILMEMBER CHEN: Thank you, Mayor. I have concerns about the 8% cost increase in this contract. Given our budget constraints, I think we should explore competitive bidding or negotiate better terms. An 8% increase is significant, especially when many residents are struggling with increased utility costs.

CITY MANAGER BRADLEY: The increase reflects rising fuel costs and wage adjustments. This contractor has provided excellent service for three years with no previous increases. The cost is still within market range based on quotes from neighboring cities.

COUNCILMEMBER WILSON: I share Councilmember Chen's concerns about the cost, but continuity of service is important. However, I think we should require quarterly performance reviews going forward.

COUNCILMEMBER GARCIA: I agree with quarterly reviews. But I also think we should lock in a multi-year rate to avoid annual increases. Can we negotiate a three-year contract with modest annual adjustments capped at 3%?

CITY MANAGER BRADLEY: I can approach the contractor about a longer-term agreement with capped increases. That might actually save money long-term.

MAYOR JOHNSON: I think that's a reasonable approach. Do we have a motion?

COUNCILMEMBER GARCIA: I move to authorize the City Manager to negotiate a three-year street sweeping contract with annual increases capped at 3%, subject to quarterly performance reviews.

COUNCILMEMBER WILSON: Second.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Discussion? All in favor?

COUNCIL: Aye. [Unanimous]

MAYOR JOHNSON: Motion carries 5-0. Let's move to our regular agenda items.

Item 6 is the community center expansion funding proposal. City Manager Bradley will present.

CITY MANAGER BRADLEY: Thank you, Mayor. As you know, we've been studying the community center expansion for eight months. The current facility serves approximately 800 residents weekly but could serve 1,200 with the proposed expansion. The total project cost is $2.3 million, which includes construction, equipment, and landscaping.

We have three funding options: Option A uses $800,000 from the capital improvement fund plus a $1.5 million bond measure. Option B delays the project one year to accumulate more capital funds, reducing the bond to $1 million. Option C phases the construction over two years with annual budget allocations.

COUNCILMEMBER DAVIS: What's the timeline for each option?

CITY MANAGER BRADLEY: Option A allows us to break ground this summer with completion by spring 2025. Option B pushes groundbreaking to summer 2025. Option C would begin this summer but wouldn't be complete until fall 2026.

COUNCILMEMBER CHEN: What's the interest rate environment for municipal bonds right now?

CITY ATTORNEY MARTINEZ: Current rates for our credit rating are approximately 4.2% for 20-year bonds. That's up from 3.1% last year but still historically reasonable.

MAYOR JOHNSON: I'm inclined toward Option A. The community need is immediate, and construction costs continue to rise. Delaying may cost us more in the long run.

COUNCILMEMBER GARCIA: I agree with the urgency, but I'm concerned about adding debt when we're already managing the water treatment plant bonds. What's our current debt service ratio?

CITY MANAGER BRADLEY: We're at 12% of general fund revenue, well below the 20% recommended maximum. The expansion bonds would bring us to 15%.

COUNCILMEMBER WILSON: That's still within acceptable range. I support Option A, but I want to ensure we have community input on the final design.

COUNCILMEMBER DAVIS: Absolutely. I suggest we hold at least two public workshops before finalizing architectural plans.

MAYOR JOHNSON: That's a good addition. Do we have a motion?

COUNCILMEMBER GARCIA: I move to approve Option A for community center expansion funding, including authorization for bond issuance up to $1.5 million, contingent on holding two public design workshops.

COUNCILMEMBER DAVIS: Second.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Discussion? 

COUNCILMEMBER CHEN: I want to ensure we have a firm cost estimate. Construction overruns have been an issue with recent projects.

CITY MANAGER BRADLEY: We'll include a 10% contingency in the budget and require fixed-price contracting with penalty clauses for delays.

MAYOR JOHNSON: All in favor?

COUNCIL: Aye. [Unanimous]

MAYOR JOHNSON: Motion carries 5-0. Excellent. This is a great investment in our community.

Let's move to item 7, the downtown revitalization plan update. 

CITY MANAGER BRADLEY: We've completed the consultant's study on downtown revitalization. The key recommendations include: creating a mixed-use overlay zone, establishing a business improvement district, upgrading streetscape infrastructure, and developing a public-private partnership for the old courthouse renovation.

The consultant estimates these improvements could generate $12 million in new investment and create 150 jobs over five years. However, the city would need to invest approximately $3.8 million in infrastructure improvements.

COUNCILMEMBER CHEN: What about the parking issues Ms. Thompson mentioned earlier? Does this plan address those concerns?

CITY MANAGER BRADLEY: Yes, the plan includes adding 200 parking spaces through a combination of street reconfiguration and a new parking structure behind the civic center.

COUNCILMEMBER WILSON: The business improvement district is interesting. What's the assessment rate proposed?

CITY MANAGER BRADLEY: The consultant recommends $2.50 per $1,000 of assessed valuation for commercial properties within the district boundaries.

COUNCILMEMBER GARCIA: Have we surveyed the businesses about their willingness to support this assessment?

CITY MANAGER BRADLEY: We sent surveys to all 87 businesses in the proposed district. We received 34 responses, with 62% supporting the concept. However, we need more comprehensive outreach.

MAYOR JOHNSON: I think we need broader community engagement before moving forward. This is a significant change that affects many stakeholders.

COUNCILMEMBER DAVIS: I agree. I suggest we form a downtown revitalization task force with business owners, residents, and property owners to review the plan in detail.

COUNCILMEMBER CHEN: Good idea. The task force should also look at phasing options. We don't have to implement everything simultaneously.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Do we have a motion to establish the task force?

COUNCILMEMBER DAVIS: I move to establish a downtown revitalization task force of nine members: three business owners, three residents, two property owners, and one council member, to review the consultant's plan and make recommendations within 90 days.

COUNCILMEMBER WILSON: Second.

MAYOR JOHNSON: All in favor?

COUNCIL: Aye. [Unanimous]

MAYOR JOHNSON: Motion carries 5-0. Staff will organize the task force selection process.

Our final item tonight is the quarterly budget report. Finance Director Peterson?

FINANCE DIRECTOR PETERSON: Thank you, Mayor. We're halfway through fiscal year 2024, and overall, we're tracking well against budget. General fund revenues are 2% above projections, primarily due to higher sales tax collections. Expenditures are 1% below budget.

However, we have some concerns: the police overtime budget is 15% over due to staffing shortages, and our road maintenance fund needs additional allocation due to winter storm damage.

COUNCILMEMBER CHEN: What's the total impact of the police overtime overrun?

FINANCE DIRECTOR PETERSON: Approximately $180,000 through December. We're working with the police chief on strategies to reduce overtime through improved scheduling and recruitment efforts.

COUNCILMEMBER WILSON: Are we on track to fill those vacant positions?

CITY MANAGER BRADLEY: We have three officers starting academy training next month, and we're interviewing candidates for two additional positions. Full staffing should be restored by summer.

COUNCILMEMBER GARCIA: What about the road maintenance shortfall?

FINANCE DIRECTOR PETERSON: We need an additional $320,000 to complete scheduled maintenance and address storm damage. We recommend transferring funds from the equipment replacement reserve.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Is that advisable? We don't want to defer necessary equipment replacements.

FINANCE DIRECTOR PETERSON: The transfer would delay two vehicle purchases by six months, but road maintenance is more urgent given safety concerns.

COUNCILMEMBER DAVIS: I support the transfer. Road safety is a priority, and we can adjust the equipment schedule.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Any objections to authorizing the transfer?

[No objections]

MAYOR JOHNSON: Staff will proceed with the transfer.

That concludes our regular agenda. Do we have any announcements?

COUNCILMEMBER CHEN: The library's winter reading program starts Monday. They're expecting record participation this year.

COUNCILMEMBER GARCIA: The senior center is hosting a health fair next Saturday from 9 AM to 2 PM. All residents are welcome.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Thank you. Our next regular meeting is February 5th. We're adjourned at 9:23 PM.
