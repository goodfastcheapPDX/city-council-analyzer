MAYOR JOHNSON: Good evening, everyone. This special meeting is called to order at 6:03 PM for our public budget hearing regarding the proposed fiscal year 2025 budget. 

Tonight we'll review the proposed $47.2 million budget, including significant changes from last year. We'll hear public comments and discuss key priorities before our final vote scheduled for March 24th.

Finance Director Peterson will begin with the budget overview.

FINANCE DIRECTOR PETERSON: Thank you, Mayor. The proposed FY2025 budget represents a 6.8% increase from the current year, primarily driven by personnel costs, infrastructure needs, and debt service.

Key highlights include:
- General Fund: $28.4 million, up 4.2%
- Capital Improvements: $8.9 million, up 22% 
- Debt Service: $3.1 million, up 15%
- Personnel costs comprise 62% of the general fund
- We're projecting 3% revenue growth from property and sales taxes

Major new initiatives include:
- Two additional police officers: $180,000
- Road resurfacing program expansion: $1.2 million
- Parks maintenance increase: $95,000
- IT infrastructure upgrade: $340,000

MAYOR JOHNSON: Thank you. Let's open the floor for public comments. We have twelve speakers signed up tonight.

First is Harold Mitchell from the Taxpayers Association.

HAROLD MITCHELL: Thank you, Mayor Johnson. The Taxpayers Association appreciates the opportunity to comment on this budget. While we understand the need for essential services, a 6.8% increase is concerning when many residents are facing economic challenges.

We question several items: Do we really need two additional police officers when crime rates are stable? The IT upgrade seems expensive - have we explored cloud-based alternatives? The parks maintenance increase appears excessive when basic services need funding.

We urge the council to find efficiencies and reduce this increase to no more than 4%, which would still exceed inflation. Government should tighten its belt just like families do.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Mitchell. Next is Police Chief Williams regarding staffing needs.

POLICE CHIEF WILLIAMS: Thank you. I want to address Mr. Mitchell's comments about police staffing. While overall crime is stable, we're seeing increases in domestic violence calls and property crimes in specific neighborhoods. 

More importantly, we're running significant overtime due to being understaffed. Adding two officers would actually save money - approximately $60,000 annually in reduced overtime costs. The net impact is only $120,000, not $180,000.

Additionally, response times in the northwest district average 8.2 minutes due to coverage gaps. Two additional officers would improve response times and officer safety.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Thank you, Chief. Next speaker is Rebecca Foster from the Chamber of Commerce.

REBECCA FOSTER: Good evening. The Chamber supports this budget, particularly the infrastructure investments. Our members consistently cite poor road conditions as a barrier to business attraction. The expanded resurfacing program addresses this critical need.

However, we encourage the council to explore revenue diversification. We're too dependent on property taxes. The downtown revitalization project we discussed last month could generate significant new business tax revenue within two years.

We also support the IT upgrades. Efficient government services help businesses, and outdated systems create delays that cost everyone money.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Thank you, Ms. Foster. Tom Reynolds, representing the Public Employees Union.

TOM REYNOLDS: Thank you, Mayor. Our union appreciates the 3.5% salary adjustment included in this budget. City employees haven't received meaningful raises in three years while costs have increased substantially.

However, we're concerned about the healthcare cost shift to employees. The proposed change would increase employee contributions by $85 per month for family coverage. This effectively reduces the salary increase to about 1.8% for many workers.

We understand budget constraints, but city employees provide essential services and deserve compensation that keeps pace with living costs. We'd prefer a smaller salary increase with maintained healthcare benefits.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Reynolds. Lisa Park, representing the Environmental Committee.

LISA PARK: Thank you. We support the overall budget but are disappointed by the lack of environmental initiatives. With climate change concerns growing, the city should invest in sustainability programs.

We propose allocating $75,000 for:
- Solar panel installation on city buildings
- Electric vehicle charging stations downtown
- Tree planting program expansion
- Recycling program improvements

These investments would reduce long-term operating costs and demonstrate environmental leadership. We urge you to find these funds within the current budget.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Thank you, Ms. Park. David Kim, Parks and Recreation Commission chair.

DAVID KIM: Thank you, Mayor. The Parks Commission strongly supports the $95,000 maintenance increase. Our facilities serve over 15,000 residents annually, but deferred maintenance is creating safety issues.

Playground equipment at Riverside Park needs replacement - we have three pieces currently out of service. The community center roof leaks during every rainstorm. The athletic fields are in poor condition due to inadequate drainage.

This funding would address immediate safety concerns and prevent more expensive repairs later. We also request consideration of a part-time groundskeeper position to improve maintenance consistency.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Kim. Maria Gonzalez from the Senior Services Advisory Board.

MARIA GONZALEZ: Good evening. Senior services deserve more attention in this budget. We serve 340 active seniors, but our transportation program is waitlisted due to limited funding.

Many seniors cannot afford Uber or taxis for medical appointments and grocery shopping. Our current van service runs three days per week but could operate five days with additional funding of just $28,000 annually.

We also need funding for facility improvements at the senior center. The HVAC system fails regularly, and accessibility improvements are needed for wheelchair users.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Thank you, Ms. Gonzalez. James Wright regarding fire department needs.

JAMES WRIGHT: Thank you. As a retired fire captain, I'm concerned about equipment replacement schedules. Engine 2 is fourteen years old and increasingly unreliable. The ladder truck needs major repairs that cost more than replacement.

While I understand budget constraints, fire equipment failures risk lives and property. We should explore leasing options or federal grants to accelerate replacement schedules without straining the budget.

I also support the proposed fire station roof repairs - water damage could compromise operations and equipment.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Thank you, Captain Wright. Sarah Davis from the Library Board.

SARAH DAVIS: Thank you, Mayor. The library budget increase is modest but appreciated. However, we need additional funding for digital services. Internet usage has increased 40% since 2022, and our bandwidth is insufficient during peak hours.

We also need more computer terminals. Residents regularly wait 30-45 minutes for computer access, which is unacceptable when people need to apply for jobs or government services online.

A $15,000 technology upgrade would significantly improve service quality and demonstrate the city's commitment to digital equity.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Thank you, Ms. Davis. Robert Chen regarding utility rates.

ROBERT CHEN: Thank you. While this hearing focuses on the general fund, I want to address utility rate increases proposed for water and sewer services. Combined with this budget's impact on property taxes, many residents face a triple burden: higher property taxes, higher utility bills, and inflation.

We need comprehensive affordability analysis. How many residents will struggle with these combined increases? What assistance programs exist? Can we phase increases over multiple years?

Government has a responsibility to consider cumulative impacts on residents, not just individual budget line items.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Chen. Jennifer Martinez, representing neighborhood associations.

JENNIFER MARTINEZ: Good evening. Neighborhood associations appreciate infrastructure investments but want assurance that improvements are distributed equitably across all districts.

The northwest area has received significant attention lately, while southeast neighborhoods still have unpaved streets and inadequate drainage. We need a multi-year plan that addresses disparities fairly.

We also support increased code enforcement funding. Property maintenance violations undermine neighborhood stability, and current enforcement is insufficient.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Thank you, Ms. Martinez. Our final speaker is Michael Torres - I believe that's our budget analyst?

BUDGET ANALYST TORRES: Yes, Mayor. I wanted to clarify several points raised tonight.

Regarding the IT upgrade costs: We did explore cloud alternatives. The proposed system would actually save $45,000 annually in software licensing fees while improving security and efficiency.

On healthcare costs: The employee contribution increase reflects statewide trends. Our healthcare costs increased 12% this year, and we're only passing 25% of that increase to employees.

Regarding revenue diversification: Staff is working on several initiatives that should generate additional revenue by FY2026, including permit fee updates and new business license categories.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Thank you. That concludes public comments. Let's have council discussion.

COUNCILMEMBER CHEN: I appreciate everyone's input tonight. Several themes emerged: affordability concerns, infrastructure needs, and service quality expectations. 

I'm particularly interested in Ms. Park's environmental proposals. Could we identify $75,000 from existing allocations for sustainability initiatives?

FINANCE DIRECTOR PETERSON: We could potentially defer some equipment purchases or reduce the contingency fund allocation. However, we're already operating with a thin margin.

COUNCILMEMBER GARCIA: I'm sympathetic to Mr. Reynolds' healthcare concerns. City employees provide valuable services, and we shouldn't shift costs to them unnecessarily. What if we split the healthcare increase - city covers half, employees cover half?

CITY MANAGER BRADLEY: That would add approximately $42,000 to personnel costs. We'd need to find those funds elsewhere.

COUNCILMEMBER WILSON: I support Chief Williams' staffing request. The overtime savings justify the expense, and public safety is a core responsibility. However, I want quarterly reports on crime statistics and response times to verify the impact.

COUNCILMEMBER DAVIS: The library's technology needs seem reasonable and important. Digital equity is increasingly critical for resident services. Can we find $15,000 for this upgrade?

MAYOR JOHNSON: I'm hearing support for several additions: environmental initiatives, healthcare cost sharing, and library technology. That's potentially $132,000 in additions to an already tight budget.

We need to prioritize. My preference is:
1. Split the healthcare cost increase - $42,000
2. Library technology upgrade - $15,000  
3. Environmental initiatives if we can identify savings

COUNCILMEMBER CHEN: I agree with those priorities. Where can we find savings?

FINANCE DIRECTOR PETERSON: Options include:
- Reducing the contingency fund by $50,000
- Deferring two vehicle purchases - $35,000 in FY2025
- Reducing professional services budget - $25,000

COUNCILMEMBER GARCIA: I'm comfortable with those reductions. The environmental initiatives send an important message about our values.

COUNCILMEMBER WILSON: I support the healthcare and library priorities, but I want to see the environmental spending prove its value before committing long-term.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Do we have consensus on the healthcare split and library technology funding?

COUNCIL: Yes. [Agreement from all members]

MAYOR JOHNSON: What about the environmental initiatives?

COUNCILMEMBER DAVIS: I support trying a pilot program this year. If we see results, we can expand next year.

COUNCILMEMBER CHEN: Agreed. Let's allocate $25,000 for environmental initiatives this year, focusing on the highest-impact projects.

MAYOR JOHNSON: That's $82,000 in additions. Finance Director, can we accommodate this with the savings you identified?

FINANCE DIRECTOR PETERSON: Yes, that works within our parameters. The adjusted budget would be $47.28 million, still a 6.9% increase.

COUNCILMEMBER WILSON: I want to address Mr. Mitchell's concerns about the overall increase. While 6.9% sounds high, we've deferred investments for years. Infrastructure doesn't improve without investment.

COUNCILMEMBER GARCIA: I agree, but we should communicate better about why these increases are necessary. Residents deserve to understand how their tax dollars create value.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Excellent point. Staff should prepare a clear communication plan explaining budget priorities and benefits to residents.

CITY MANAGER BRADLEY: We'll develop informational materials and consider community presentations before the final vote.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Any other discussion items?

COUNCILMEMBER CHEN: I want to revisit the senior transportation issue Ms. Gonzalez raised. $28,000 for expanded van service seems reasonable and addresses a real need.

COUNCILMEMBER GARCIA: I agree. Senior services are important, and transportation access affects healthcare and quality of life.

FINANCE DIRECTOR PETERSON: We could fund this through the human services allocation or find additional savings in vehicle maintenance.

COUNCILMEMBER DAVIS: I support adding senior transportation funding. We're talking about essential services for vulnerable residents.

MAYOR JOHNSON: That would bring our additions to $110,000. Are we comfortable with this level of changes?

COUNCILMEMBER WILSON: Yes, if we can identify the savings. These are all worthwhile investments in our community.

FINANCE DIRECTOR PETERSON: I recommend taking the additional $28,000 from vehicle maintenance savings and equipment deferrals. The total adjusted budget would be $47.31 million.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Are there any objections to these modifications?

[No objections from council]

MAYOR JOHNSON: Excellent. Staff will prepare the revised budget incorporating:
- Healthcare cost sharing: $42,000
- Library technology upgrade: $15,000
- Environmental initiatives pilot: $25,000  
- Senior transportation expansion: $28,000

Total additions: $110,000, funded through identified savings.

This hearing has been very productive. The final budget vote is scheduled for March 24th. Are there any other items?

COUNCILMEMBER CHEN: I want to thank everyone who participated tonight. Public input makes our decisions better.

COUNCILMEMBER GARCIA: I agree. This is exactly how local government should work - transparent discussion of priorities with community input.

MAYOR JOHNSON: Thank you all for your engagement. The revised budget documents will be available on the city website by Friday.

Our next regular meeting is March 19th, with the budget adoption vote on March 24th. We're adjourned at 8:47 PM.
