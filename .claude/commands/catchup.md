You are catching up on this project after time away. Follow these exact steps in this exact order to understand the current state and suggest next tasks. Do not do tasks other than these. For example, do not run `npm run dev`, `npm test`, `npm build` or any other scripts. This catchup should be strictly contextual. If you feel these tasks are important, you can recommend them in your summary.
