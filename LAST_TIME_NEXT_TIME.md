# Last Time / Next Time

## Last Time (2025-06-19)

### What We Accomplished
✅ **Backend API Validation**
- Confirmed POST `/api/transcripts` endpoint is working correctly
- Successfully uploaded test transcripts to Vercel Blob Storage
- Verified blob storage integration and metadata handling
- Tested API with realistic city council transcript data

✅ **Sample Data Creation**
- Created `sample-data/` directory with realistic test files
- Added comprehensive city council meeting transcripts
- Included budget hearing and regular meeting examples
- Files ready for testing upload and processing workflows

✅ **System Architecture Verification**
- Confirmed Next.js development server runs successfully
- Validated storage layer integration (Vercel Blob + Supabase)
- Tested API schema validation and error handling
- Identified frontend uses mock implementations (needs connection)

### Current Status
- **Backend APIs**: ✅ Working (upload tested successfully)
- **Sample Data**: ✅ Ready for testing
- **Frontend**: ❌ Uses mock data, needs API connection
- **Data Listing**: ❌ GET endpoint shows count but no items

### Key Files Added
- `sample-data/README.md` - Documentation for test files
- `sample-data/city-council-2024-01-15.txt` - Regular meeting transcript
- `sample-data/city-council-2024-03-10.txt` - Budget hearing transcript  
- `test-upload.json` - API testing payload

## Next Time

### Immediate Tasks (Next Session)

1. **Frontend API Integration**
   - [ ] Fix GET `/api/transcripts` listing issue (shows count but no items)
   - [ ] Replace mock implementations in `TranscriptUpload.tsx` with real API calls
   - [ ] Update file upload to handle `.txt` files (currently only accepts JSON)
   - [ ] Test complete upload → storage → display workflow

2. **User Interface Testing**
   - [ ] Test file upload through the web interface using sample data
   - [ ] Verify uploaded transcripts appear in the list view
   - [ ] Check error handling for invalid files and large uploads
   - [ ] Test responsive design and user experience flow

3. **Data Persistence Validation**
   - [ ] Debug why uploaded transcripts don't appear in GET response
   - [ ] Verify Supabase database connectivity and data insertion
   - [ ] Test transcript retrieval by individual ID
   - [ ] Confirm blob storage and metadata sync properly

4. **Complete End-to-End Testing**
   - [ ] Upload all sample transcript files through the UI
   - [ ] Verify data appears correctly in both blob storage and database
   - [ ] Test search and filtering functionality (if implemented)
   - [ ] Performance test with larger transcript files

5. **Development Environment Polish**
   - [ ] Add proper error handling and user feedback in the UI
   - [ ] Implement loading states and progress indicators
   - [ ] Add file format validation and size limits
   - [ ] Create redirect from `/` to `/dashboard/transcripts`

### API Testing Commands
Backend is working and can be tested directly:
```bash
# Test GET endpoint
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/transcripts

# Test POST endpoint with sample data
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/transcripts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @test-upload.json

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Current Issues to Address
1. **Listing Bug**: GET `/api/transcripts` returns `{"items":[],"total":2}` - count is correct but items array is empty
2. **Frontend Disconnect**: Upload component uses mock functions instead of real API calls
3. **File Format**: Frontend only accepts JSON but backend supports text formats

### Notes
- Backend storage layer (Vercel Blob + Supabase) is confirmed working
- Sample transcript data is ready in `sample-data/` directory
- API schema validation working correctly
- Need to connect frontend to working backend APIs
