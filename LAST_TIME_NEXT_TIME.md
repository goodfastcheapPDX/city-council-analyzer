### What We Accomplished
✅ **Complete Docker Containerization**
- Built production Dockerfile with Next.js standalone output
- Created development Dockerfile with hot reload and debugging
- Set up docker-compose.yml with PostgreSQL, Redis, and app services
- Fixed environment variable loading via `.env.docker` files
- Added comprehensive DOCKER.md documentation
- Updated package.json scripts for Docker workflows
- Successfully tested container startup and service orchestration

✅ **Project Cleanup** 
- Removed unused `src/middleware.ts` file
- Updated Next.js config for Docker compatibility
- Committed all changes with detailed commit message

### Key Files Added
- `Dockerfile` & `Dockerfile.dev` - Container definitions
- `docker-compose.yml` - Service orchestration  
- `DOCKER.md` - Complete usage documentation
- `.dockerignore` - Optimized build context
- `docker/postgres/init.sql` - Database initialization

## Next Time

### Immediate Tasks (Next Session)

1. **Docker Environment Improvements**
   - [ ] Replace plain PostgreSQL with local Supabase instance in docker-compose
   - [ ] Add Supabase CLI setup and local development instructions
   - [ ] Update Docker environment to match production Supabase architecture
   - [ ] Ensure pgvector extension and proper schema migrations

2. **Test Data & App Validation**
   - [ ] Get sample transcript data for testing
   - [ ] Start Docker environment: `npm run docker:up`  
   - [ ] Test file upload through the web interface
   - [ ] Verify data persistence and processing

3. **Testing Infrastructure** 
   - [ ] Run test suite in Docker: `docker-compose --profile test up test`
   - [ ] Verify all tests pass in containerized environment
   - [ ] Check test coverage reports

4. **User Experience Improvements**
   - [ ] Add Next.js redirect from `/` to `/dashboard/transcripts`
   - [ ] Create GitHub issue to revert redirect when proper landing page is built
   - [ ] Test navigation flow

5. **Remote Services Health Check**
   - [ ] Verify Vercel deployment is still functional
   - [ ] Check Supabase project status and connectivity  
   - [ ] Validate API keys and service integrations
   - [ ] Test blob storage upload/download functionality

### Development Environment Ready
Docker setup is complete and tested. Use these commands:
```bash
# Start development environment
npm run docker:up

# Stop environment  
npm run docker:down

# Run tests
docker-compose --profile test up test
```

### Notes
- All environment variables should be configured in `.env.docker`
- PostgreSQL and Redis services included for full local development
- Hot reload enabled for iterative development
- Production build pipeline ready for deployment
