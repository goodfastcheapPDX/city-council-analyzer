# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE IS @claude/rules/mvp.md. MVP is the golden rule!

| Gate           | What it must do                                                                                                                          | Fail condition                                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **MVP Gate**   | Claude lists **only** the tasks strictly needed to satisfy each acceptance criterion once. Anything else is pushed to “Deferred Ideas.”  | If MVP tasks don’t map 1-to-1 to criteria, abort plan generation.   |
| **YAGNI Gate** | For every proposed task, Claude must answer: “What breaks if we skip this?” If the answer is vague or speculative, move task to backlog. | If ≥1 task lacks a concrete breakage description, plan is rejected. |


## Project Overview

This is a Next.js application called "transcript-analysis-system" that manages city council transcript uploads, storage, and analysis. The system uses Supabase Storage for file storage and Supabase for metadata persistence and vector embeddings.

**For detailed architecture**: See @claude/architecture-plan.md

## Quick Reference

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start development server
npm run build            # Build for production
npm run lint             # Run ESLint

# Testing
npm run test             # Run all tests
npm run test:storage     # Run storage tests (sequential)

```

### Core Architecture
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (files) + Supabase (metadata + vectors)
- **Processing**: Multi-stage pipeline with job queue
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI embeddings + vector search + RAG pipeline
- **API**: RESTful endpoints + WebSocket for real-time updates
- **Logging**: Structured logging with Adze for observability and debugging

### Runtime Boundary Rules (Critical)
- **NEVER mix server and client runtime code in the same file**
- **Keep browser-specific imports separate from Node.js-specific imports**  
- **Use environment-specific factory patterns**: `factories/server.ts`, `factories/client.ts`, `factories/test.ts`
- **API Routes (`app/api/`)**: Only import server-side libraries and factories
- **Client Components**: Only import client-side libraries and factories
- **Shared Code**: Keep in separate files with no runtime dependencies (types only)

## Development Guidelines

### Development Methodology
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** - Always write tests before implementation
- **Red-Green-Refactor** cycle for all new functionality
- **Behavior specification** through tests, not implementation details

**For TDD guidelines**: See @claude/rules/test-driven-development.md

### Development Workflow
- **Commit batching** and **branch management** for optimal development velocity
- **Parallel development planning** to identify concurrent work opportunities
- **Phase-based implementation** for complex issues with clear milestones
- I keep the dev server running in a separate tab for efficiency.

**For workflow optimization guidelines**: See @claude/rules/development-workflow-strategy.md

##### Good Examples
| # | Practice                                                             | Example                                                                             |
| - | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | **Single source of truth** per category (scope + status + priority). | `scope:🛹`, `status:ready`, `P3` — nothing redundant.                               |
| 2 | **Mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive** labels.              | Only one of `status:*` may be present; pipelines enforce swap when state changes.   |
| 3 | **Consistent color semantics** across repos.                         | Greens = status, Blues = scope, Reds = priority → visual scan tells pipeline stage. |
| 4 | **Automated pruning of stale labels**.                               | CI bot strips `status:in-progress` when PR merged, adds `status:review`.            |
| 5 | **Docs live next to labels**.                                        | `docs/labels.md` links each label to a one-sentence rule and onboarding quiz.       |

##### Bad Examples
| # | Anti-Pattern                               | Illustration                                                                                                                             |
| - | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | **Label soup** — ten+ labels that overlap. | `bug`, `defect`, `error`, `failure`, `broken🔧`, `scope:🚗` on the same issue.                                                           |
| 2 | **Conflicting states**.                    | An issue tagged both `status:blocked` and `status:ready`.                                                                                |
| 3 | **Color chaos**.                           | Random pastel palette where `P4` is pale mint and `scope:🛹` is dark red.                                                                |
| 4 | **Forgotten YAGNI flags**.                 | Issue closed months ago still marked `scope:yagni?`, confusing search filters.                                                           |
| 5 | **Free-text brainstorm** as labels.        | Adding ad-hoc labels like `needs-brainstorm`, `maybe-later?`, `experimental-ish` instead of using `status:unclear` or `status:deferred`. |

### Testing Strategy
- **Property-based testing** with Fast-Check for edge cases
- **Realistic environments** over mocking (SQLite, Docker)
- **Sequential storage tests** (`--max-concurrency=1`)
- **80% coverage** minimum for all components

**For detailed testing guidance**: See @claude/rules/testing-strategy.md

### Property-Based Testing Guidance
- **Remember to reference the @claude/rules/property-based-testing-guide.md rule when planning tests and engaging in TDD**
- **Remember to check the @claude/rules/visual-testing-guide.md when planning tests or engaging in TDD**

### Testing Best Practices
- When writing unit tests, always reference the actual input data in the assertion instead of recreating logic or patterns emulating the input data. For example, `expect(actual.id).toMatch(input.id)`, not `expect(actual.id).toMatch(/some-regex-that-looks-like-input-id/)`

### Issue Management
- **Detailed specifications** required for all GitHub issues
- **Clear dependencies** and acceptance criteria
- **Property-based testing** requirements included
- **Use labels when creating github issues. if labels that make sense don't exist yet in the project, create new labels**

**For issue creation standards**: See @claude/rules/backlog-management.md

### Commit Standards
- **Conventional commits** with detailed explanations
- **Run typecheck before commits**: Always run `npm run typecheck` before committing
- **Claude Code attribution** footer required
- **No commits without explicit user request**
- **When making a commit reflecting task completion, update the LAST_TIME_NEXT_TIME.md file to record that**
- **You only need to run typecheck before the commit, not after**
- **Write to LAST_TIME_NEXT_TIME.md before making commits**

**For commit guidelines**: See @claude/rules/git-commit-style.md

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Storage
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_key

# AI Services (for embeddings and analysis)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key

# GitHub Integration
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
```

### Project Configuration
Key settings in @src/lib/config.ts:
- **Token limits**: 4000 max per segment, 200 overlap
- **Storage**: 50MB max file size via Supabase Storage
- **Processing**: Configurable quality levels and strategies
- **Logging**: Environment-aware structured logging with Adze (correlation IDs, performance timing)

## Claude Rules System

This repository includes automated guidance in the @claude directory:

### When Claude Should Check Rules
- Starting work on GitHub issues
- Creating or updating project documentation  
- Making architectural decisions
- User requests that match rule patterns

### Available Rules
- `test-driven-development.md` - TDD methodology and best practices
- `testing-strategy.md` - Property-based testing approach
- `backlog-management.md` - Issue creation and dependency tracking
- `git-commit-style.md` - Commit message standards  
- `issue-modernization-plan.md` - Architectural alignment process

### Rule Discovery Process
1. Check `ls claude/rules/` for applicable rules
2. Read relevant rules with `Read` tool
3. Apply step-by-step instructions
4. Validate using rule-specific criteria

**For rule management**: See @claude/rule-management.md

## Implementation Status

### Recently Completed Infrastructure
- ✅ **Supabase Storage Migration** (Issue #129/#130) - Complete replacement of Vercel Blob with Supabase Storage
- ✅ **Structured Logging System** (Issue #141) - Adze-based logging with correlation IDs and performance timing
- ✅ **Date Standardization** (Issues #111-#113) - dateUtils library with Luxon backing, UTC enforcement

### Phase 1: Foundation (P0) - Core Infrastructure Complete
✅ Database schema and API middleware
✅ Supabase storage and validation systems  
✅ Multi-format parsers and token counting

### Phase 2: Intelligence (P1) - Ready for Development  
6 issues for vector embeddings and search

### Phase 3: Analysis (P2) - Blocked by P1  
3 issues for RAG pipeline and LLM integration

**For complete roadmap**: See @claude/implementation-roadmap.md

## Key Constraints

### Performance Requirements
- API responses: <500ms typical, <2s maximum
- Token counting: <100ms estimation, <2s precise
- Vector search: <200ms with caching
- File processing: <30s for 10MB transcripts

### Quality Standards
- Test coverage: 80% minimum across all metrics
- Parsing accuracy: >98% for supported formats
- Search relevance: >90% user satisfaction
- Error recovery: >95% automatic resolution

### Security
- Private blob access by default
- RLS policies for all database operations
- API key authentication required
- CORS configured for production domains

## Session Coordination

### Development Session Tracking
- **@LAST_TIME_NEXT_TIME.md**: Session coordination file that maintains continuity across development sessions:
  - **"Last Time" section**: Documents what was accomplished in the previous session
  - **"Current Status"**: Tracks project state with clear ✅/❌ indicators
  - **"Next Time" tasks**: Lists specific actionable priorities for the upcoming session
  - **Testing commands**: Provides ready-to-run validation commands
  - **Current issues**: Notes blockers and bugs that need resolution
  
This approach ensures no time is wasted figuring out where development left off and maintains focus on planned priorities across multi-system integrations (Next.js, Vercel Blob, Supabase).

This document provides essential information for productive development. For detailed specifications, consult the architecture plan and implementation roadmap in the `claude/` directory.

## Development Memories

### Core Development Principles
- **Minimal Solution Approach**: Always write the minimum possible code to satisfy a requirement. Think skateboard → scooter → bike → motorcycle → car. Avoid frame → engine → body → interior → car
- **Date Handling**: Always use the new date lib when working with dates throughout the stack. Never use native Date functions or directly use the Luxon lib outside of our config interface
- **Runtime Boundaries**: Keep browser-specific imports separate from Node.js-specific imports (see Runtime Boundary Rules above)

### Technical Implementation Memories
- **Supabase CLI**: Use `npx supabase...` not `supabase...`
- **TypeScript Types**: Prefer `as const` for types with finite known permutations
- **GitHub Issues**: Use status labels (status:blocked, status:review, status:in-progress, status:ready) and organize related issues into epics with the epic label

**For detailed development guidance**: See @claude/rules/development-memories.md
